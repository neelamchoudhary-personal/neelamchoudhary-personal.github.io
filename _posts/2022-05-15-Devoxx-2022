## Ancedotes to use
* If there are 2 choices and then can look like if they going yielding same result 
then maybe worth spending time to figure out the inflection point for the diversion
as that may allow you to change accordingly .. to add an example 
* Roadmap with one road is not much of a roadmap
* Deacceleration is type of accelartion as we would not like to drive a car without not brakes.
The slowing allows you to observe and pivot if required
* Dont have the time to do the right thing but have enought time to do it again 
* When you say something non-* .. we talk about what it is but not what it is.
